# Leave-Management-App
Leave-Management-App is a web application built using Power Apps, SharePoint, and Power Automate to streamline the process of managing leave requests within an organization.

# Features
- Home Page: The home page provides an overview of all leave requests, displaying their current status (approved, denied, or pending). It allows users to quickly view the details of each request, such as the dates, reason, and employee information.

- Leave Request Form: The app includes a user-friendly form that employees can use to submit their leave requests. The form captures essential information like the start and end dates of the leave, the reason, and any additional comments.

- Approval Workflow: The leave requests submitted by employees follow an approval workflow. The requests are automatically routed to the respective manager and HR personnel for review and approval. Power Automate is used to manage the workflow, ensuring that the right individuals are notified at each step.

- Manager and HR Approval: Managers and HR personnel can access a dedicated section within the app to review and approve or deny leave requests. They have the ability to leave comments or provide feedback to the requesting employee.
